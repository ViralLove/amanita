# Amanita Architecture Overview

## System Vision

Amanita is a decentralized ecosystem that bridges traditional e-commerce with blockchain technology, creating a network of seller nodes connected through shared smart contracts. Each seller maintains their own e-commerce solution while participating in a collective marketplace infrastructure.

## Core Architecture Principles

- **Decentralized Seller Nodes**: Each seller operates independently with their own e-commerce platform
- **Shared Blockchain Infrastructure**: Common smart contracts provide marketplace functionality
- **Bridge Architecture**: Amanita connects existing e-commerce systems to blockchain
- **Trust Through Technology**: Invite system and on-chain reputation ensure community quality
- **Cross-Seller Cooperation**: Product sharing and cross-selling with shared rewards
