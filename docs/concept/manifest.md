# Amanita Manifest

## Cosmic Mission

Amanita is not just a technological project. It is a bridge between the digital and spiritual worlds, between technology and cosmic energies. We create an ecosystem where every participant can find their path to harmony with the Universe through decentralized commerce, trust, and cooperation.
